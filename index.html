              <div class="subheading mb-3">just install MaNGOSBot addon</div>
              <p>The best way to interact with bots is to use the <a href="https://github.com/ike3/mangosbot-addon">MaNGOSBot addon</a>. Just select your bot and click the appropriate buttons. There are keybinding available such as commands to follow you, stop moving, attack etc. <a href="https://github.com/ike3/mangosbot-EngBags">MaNGOSBot EngBags</a> addon provides an easy way to manage bot inventory and craft items. You do not need to do anything though - just invite bots to your group, command them to follow and the AI will take care for everything else.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">via chat commands</div>
              <p>Bots are self-capable of doing usual WoW stuff, but the power of the mod is in the chat commands you could use to tell bots what and how to to it. For example, you can tell them to start clearing the area of mobs while you doing something more interesting. Or command to go to a mailbox, check the mail and maybe send you some items or gold. As everything is none via chat you can create macros and other addons to even more precise control.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">combat and non-combat mode</div>
              <p>The engine uses reactive AI so the bots watch for something happens and react by doing something. There are different ways how to react (strategies), and you can tell bots which one to use now. For example, you can swith a warrior to be a tank or dps. A mage can use frost, fire or arcane rotations. A priest could a healer or a shadow dps. You can tell the bots how to buff players (increasing their dps, mana regen or maybe threat). You can even create your own scripts how to react to the AI events.</p>

Each level-up gives you 3 attribute points which can be spent on Strength, Agility, Intellect, Stamina or Spirit for a small fee.

              <p>All your alts are leveled with you if they are not in a group. So whenever you get XP or reputation, they get 90% of the amount gained as well. You don't need to level all 5 of your alts independently playing the same content 5 times to be ready for a dungeon. Completing a quest also marks it as completed for all your alts. They do not receive any rewards or gold though. So you would need more gold to buy them skills and attributes.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Installation Guide</h2>

          <p>Installing mangosbot can be tricky but easy if you are familiar with the MaNGOS core itself. Basically you need to enable some settings during compilation and apply additional SQL files to your DB and copy some config files to your realm.</p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Workflow</div>
          <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Checkout the code from the appropriate branch depending on the game version you want to use. There are a little changes to the core itself, mostly some hook points to call the MaNGOSBot code. You can even checkout other version of the core and apply these changes manually (search of #ifdef ENABLE_PLAYERBOTS for more information).</li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Update all submodules to the latest version. The references to submodules are usually outdated so it is a good idea to pull them manually so the latest version will be used. It is always compatible with the main code.</li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Configure and build the code. Make sure to set ENABLE_PLAYERBOTS and ENABLE_IMMERSIVE to true.</li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Apply SQL files from modules/Bots/sql and modules/Immersive/sql to the appropriate DBs (see file names such as characters_*.sql and world_*.sql)</li>
            <li>
              <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
              Configure AhBot, Immersive and MaNGOSBot by putting ahbot.conf, immersive.conf and aiplayerbot.conf to your config directory (where mangosd.conf is located). Feel free to change any value, although the default ones are fine too. This actually enables the features so the config files are mandatory.</li>
              <li>
                <i class="fa-li fa fa-check"></i>
                Run the server. The first run can be quite slow as a vast number of random characters will be created. It is recommended to init them all at once by running "rndbot init" console command, wait for it to complete and restart the server. If you do not run the server for more than couple days it is a good idea to repeat the initialization process again.</li>

            <h2 class="mb-5">Download</h2>
            <p>MaNGOSBot is available as source code only. You need to build it using the appropriate tools for your platform.</p>
            <pre>git clone https://github.com/ike3/mangosbot.git</pre>
          </div>
        </section>

        <div class="my-auto">
          <h2 class="mb-5">How to play the game</h2>
          <p>Create your main character and a number of alts. They will levelup simultaneously so it is a good idea to create alts early on.</p>
          <p>Log in to the game as a main character. You'll notice that all your alts are now staying near your main character and they are ready to play. Invite them to your group and use MaNGOSBot Addon to see what you can customize.</p>
          <p>It is recommended to assign some keyboard shortcuts to MaNGOSBot Addon key binding such as Follow, Stay, Attack, Flee etc to quickly command all your party to do something. Now make them follow you and start playing the game as usually.</p>
          <h3>Questing</h3>
          <p>Grab a quest from a quest giver - your alts will grab it too. Start killing the mobs for the quest - your alts will help you: the tank will grab the aggro, the healer will heal, others will damage your targets, everyone will apply some buffs. They will loot the quest items if necessary and report to chat their progress with quests.</p>
          <p>If the quest requires to use some gameobjects you can ask bots to tell you all they see. Whisper or use a group chat:</p>
            <pre>los</pre>
          <p>Your alts will reply with a lot of game links: game objects, units, NPCs and players located nearby. Choose the correct one and command:
            <pre>u [gameobject]</pre>
            [gameobject] is the gameobject link (Shift-click the links provided by bot and it will be copied to the chat box).
            The bot will use this game object and completed the quest.
          </p>
          <p>When the quest is done, go to the quest giver and turn it in. The bots will turn the quest in too and get the XP and any rewards if it is available. Not that if the quest has multiple rewards, you need to tell you bots which one to choose. Just whisper to each player a command such as:
            <pre>r [item]</pre>
            [item] is a item link (Shift-click to the quest reward to copy it to the chat box). Then the bot will turn the quest in choosing this reward.
          </p>
          <p>Now you can do some quests with your alts for a while and they will level up with you. Of course they will get XP and reputation from killing as any other player in your group.</p>

          <h3>Items and inventory</h3>
          <p>When looting you'll notice that bots sometimes say that the just looted item could be useful in some way. For example, they could equip or use it. Or you may have an item you can spare for your alt or maybe they will have something useful for you.</p>
          <p>It is time to exchange those items and equip something new! Just select a bot and click Inventory button on the MaNGOSBot Addon. Provided you installed MaNGOSBot-EngBags extension, the window will pop-up showing the bot inventory. You can use the context menu to ask the bot to add any item to the trade window, to equip gear, to use potions, to sell gray stuff, or even to destroy the unwanted items. You can give them your items and gold when trading.</p>
          <p>Alternative way to do so is using the chat commands. You can find more information in advanced guide, but in general you need to whisper commands such as (small text is the command description):
            <pre>u [item] <small>to <b>u</b>se this item</small></pre>
            <pre>e [item] <small>to <b>e</b>quip this item</small></pre>
            <pre>ue [item] <small>to <b>u</b>n<b>e</b>quip this item</small></pre>
            <pre>t [item] <small>to add the item to the <b>t</b>rade window</small></pre>
            <pre>b [item] <small>to <b>b</b>uy this item from a vendor nearby</small></pre>
            <pre>s [item] <small>to <b>s</b>ell this item</small></pre>
            <pre>destroy [item] <small>to destroy the item</small></pre>
          </p>

          <h3>Learning skills</h3>
          <p>Now it is time to learn some skills and attributes. Go to the class trainer and start talking. The bots will whisper in chat what they could learn. Say:
            <pre>trainer learn</pre>
            And the bot will learn all these skills.
          </p>
          <p>Buying attributes is done by talking to the npc. This is done using the <b>talk</b> command:</p>
              <pre>talk</pre>
          <p>And the bot will whisper you everything the NPC said to him. Note than all options have a number before them. Whisper:</p>
              <pre>talk 2</pre>
              2 - is the number of an option and the bot will choose this option and the conversation will go on. So you can buy the attributes now.
            </p>
          <p>You can learn this way any skill including weapons, crafting, spells etc.</p>
          <p>Hey, they have not enough gold to do so! Is it time to play the game and get some stuff to sell!</p>

          <h3>Crafting</h3>
          <p>Now it is time to craft something. Use MaNGOSBot Addon and click Spells button. The window will pop-up showing all craftable items that bot can craft. Just use context menu to craft it. They could create something useful for you too!</p>

          <h3>Checking stats</h3>
          <p>Sometimes you need to check some information about the bot current stats, level etc. There are some commands available:
              <pre>stats <small>to see bot gold, XP, item durability</small></pre>
              <pre>who <small>to see bot overall information such as level, talents etc</small></pre>
              <pre>who [skill] <small>to see level of that skill, eg. skinning</small></pre>
              <pre>ready <small>to see overall bot readyness to fight</small></pre>
          </p>

          <h3>Solo play</h3>
          <p>Bored to do a group play? Then disband the party and play alone for some time. Is it usually a good idea to leave all your alts near a mailbox or at the inn so you can send them items or even teleport to them. Do not worry: the bots will still level up with you, so you won't outlevel them.</p>
          <p>The easiest way to disband the party is to whisper:
            <pre>leave</pre>
            or use the MaNGOSBot addon. Note that if you just leave the party, others will still remain in theirs party (now without you) and they will stop getting  shared XP, rep, do quests etc. So, <i>leave</i> command makes all bots to leave the party effectively disbanding it.
          </p>
          <p>Got something useful for others during solo play? Send it to your alts via a mailbox. Even if you are far away from them, whisper:
            <pre>mail ?</pre>
            Provided your alts were near a mailbox, they will show all their mail in chat. Again, note numbers before mails - they are used in mail commands:</p>
            <pre>mail take 5 - <small>Take all items from mail number 5</small></pre>
            <pre>mail read 5 - <small>Read mail number 5</small></pre>
            <pre>mail delete 5 - <small>Delete mail number 5</small></pre>
            <pre>sendmail [item] - <small>Send [item] to you</small></pre>
            <pre>sendmail [item] [player] - <small>Send [item] to a specific [player]</small></pre>
          <p>When you are done with solo, you could easily return to your bots. Either summon them to you or ask them to summon you instead:
            <pre>summon</pre>
            Summoning player need to be near a meeting stone or an innkeeper to be able to do so. That's why you've brought your alts to the inn before!
          </p>
          <p>Maybe now it is time to go for a dungeon? Do not forget to grab the necessary quests or just share yours with bots.</p>
          <p>Happy looting!</p>
